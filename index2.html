    <p style="color:white">Welcome to the <sub>unofficial</sub> John Walker Justice webpage. Captain Walker was an excellent Captain America, but he was dishonorably discharged for doing his job. <del style="color:red">It's all that Sam "Falcon" Wilson's fault, along with those other damn terrorist super soldiers.</del> By the time we're done here, the <b>REAL</b> Captain America will be back in business, and not that flying psycho!</p>
